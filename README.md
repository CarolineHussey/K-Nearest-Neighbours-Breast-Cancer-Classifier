# K-Nearest Neighbours Breast Cancer Classifier
 Codecademy Project for K-nearest neighbours supervised machine learning classification model.  The model is trained using breast cancer data to predict wwhether a patient has breast cancer or not.  
 
 Data is provided from sklearn's dataset library. 
 
 The project is presented in Jupyter notebook. sklearn is used to split training and test data, and KNeighboursClassifier is used to train and validate a classification model.
 
 Predictions are scored with sklearn's .score method, and these scores are plotted on a simple line graph to visualise prediction accuracy.
